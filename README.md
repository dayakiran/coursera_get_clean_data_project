### Introduction
The Run_Analysis.R script gets the sensor data collected by the Samsung Galaxy S phone. The training and test data is then merged. The measurements for mean and standard deviation are then extracted from the file. The script assigns headers to the extracted dataset and then creates a file which contains the average of each variable and each subject.

The assumption is that the data is available in the file.
